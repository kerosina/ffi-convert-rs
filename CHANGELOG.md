## [Unreleased]
### Added

### Changed
- Make `CArray` fields public

### Fixed

## [0.6.1] - 2023-03-23
### Added

### Changed
 - Performance improvements for `CReprOf` and `AsRust` of `CArray` when using primitive types

### Fixed
 - Add missing impl of `RawPointerConverter` for `CStringArray`

## [0.6.0] - 2023-01-18
### Added
 - `CDrop` `CReprOf` and `AsRust` are now implemented for fixed size arrays.

### Changed
 - Updated rust edition to 2021

### Removed
 - Removed legacy `CReprOfConvertOverrideArgs` and `TargetNameArgs` struct that weren't used in the api anymore

## [0.5.0] - 2021-02-23
### Added
 - `CDrop` and `CReprOf` are now implemented for `u8` and `i8`.

### Changed 
 - `bool` in Rust is no longer converted to `u8` in C. Instead it is converted to `bool`, which is guaranteed to be the same as `_Bool` in C.
 - The `size` field of `CStringArray` is now an `usize`

## [0.4.0] - 2020-12-17
### Added
 - `as_rust_extra_field` attribute for `AsRust` custom derive, can be used to specify initialize fields in the rust struct that are not present in the C one
 - `c_repr_of_convert` attribute for `CReprOf` custom derive, can be used to perform custom conversion. Note that fields with this attribute are ignored by the `AsRust` custom derive.
 - `target_name` attribute for `AsRust` and `CReprOf` custom derive, can be used if a field has different names in rust and C
 
### Changed
 - `RawPointerConverter` no longer has a blanket implementation for all types (this could to easily be misused leading to nasty errors), the trait as been reworked to include mut variants, and a custom derive has been added for it

### Fixed
 - Missing `Drop` implementation for `CStringArray` causing memory leaks

### Removed
 - Removed the `point_to_string` legacy function (this should have been marked `unsafe` and has no place in this crate)


## [0.3.0] - 2020-10-05
### Added
 - `CReprOf`, `CDrop` and `AsRust` implementations for `bool`
### Fixed
 - Typos in doc
### Changed
 - Error management is now using `thiserror` instead of `failure`
### Removed
 - Legacy conversion macros, use directly the traits instead
 
## [0.2.2] - 2020-06-15
### Added
 - `Debug` impl for `CArray<T>`

## [0.2.1] - 2020-04-08
### Fixed
 - `CDrop` custom derive now honors the `#[nullable]` field attribute

## [0.2.0] - 2020-03-32
### Added
 - `CRange` a struct representing a `Range` with implementations for `CReprOf`, `CDrop` and `AsRust`

## [0.1.2] - 2020-03-23
### Fixed
 - use fully qualified names in macros

## [0.1.1] - 2020-03-19
### Fixed
 - double free on pointer fields

## [0.1.0] - 2020-03-17
### Added
 - first release
